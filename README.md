<h3>Story</h3>

<p>Today, most of the products that we produce have a very crucial factor affecting them, temperature. Starting from the traditional crops to the artificial ones in food industries, from drugs to chemicals manufactured in the pharmaceutical industries, all of them need the right amount of temperature to be maintained for manufacture which is why the monitoring of temperature constantly is an indispensable part of these sectors.</p>

<p>Our homes too have a thermostat installed which monitor and regulate the temperature. Maintaining the right temperature is required for having a healthy growth of plants in a greenhouse. If the right temperature is not maintained, the plants will die.</p>

<h3><strong>What will you build as part of this project?</strong></h3>
<li>Using this project, you will be able to build a temperature monitoring system to collect the data and send it to the cloud.</li>
<li>You will also learn to visualise the data in form of graphs.</li>
<li>This project can then be extended to Predict the future sensor values via machine learning over the Bolt Cloud.</li>

<h1>Gathering all required components</h1>
<li>Here is what you need for the project. All of these components are included in the Bolt Starter Kit.</li>
